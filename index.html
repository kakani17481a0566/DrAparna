        <p>My career has never followed a straight line — and that's
          intentional. I have worked at the crossroads of scientific
          discovery, technological innovation, and human
          development, always with a belief that no single
          discipline holds all the answers. From leading data-driven
          research at the European Union's Joint Research Centre,
          to developing learning frameworks for children and
          adults, to building businesses that serve real human
          needs — every step has been about bridging knowledge
          with compassion.

        My vision is to revolutionize Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in India by empowering teachers and

            <h4>2004 – EU's Joint Research Commission Award</h4>
            <p>
              Honored as <strong>Best IT Consultant of the Year</strong> by the EU's Joint Research Commission
              for dedicated work in the Human Medicines Department, Ispra, Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a successful IT career, I transitioned back to academia — completing a
              <strong>Master's in English from Cambridge</strong> and a
              <strong>Doctorate in Child Psychology from the University of Essex</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This phase marked a deep personal evolution. As a woman entrepreneur,
              vulnerability often manifested as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.
              Embracing these emotions instead of resisting them gave me the courage
              to grow and lead with empathy and resilience.
